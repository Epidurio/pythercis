# PytherCIS
Simple python bindings/client library for the Ethercis openEHR CDR (and other compatible openEHR Clinical Data Repositories)


## Installation

Install PytherCIS from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`
```bash
pip install pythercis
```

Install an openEHR clinical data repository to interact with. The easiest way to get access to one of these is:
* use the resources of the [Code4Health Platform](https://platform.code4health.org/#/), which gives you free dev/testing access to an instance of the non-free, proprietary, Marand openEHR CDR. Both EtherCIS and Marand aim to adhere to the same openEHR standards and a similar REST API design, so they are cross-compatible although no guarantee of call-for-call API-level compatibility is given.
* install an instance of the [EtherCIS](http://ethercis.org/) open source openEHR CDR locally, by following the instructions below. (note the prerequisites: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))


Clone the [docker-ethercis](https://github.com/operonflow/docker-ethercis) repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/operonflow/docker-ethercis.git
```

Enter the relevant directory
```bash
cd docker-ethercis
```

Start up Docker Compose, which will orchestrate the creation and setup of Docker containers for the EtherCIS server and its PostgresQL database. If all goes well, it's a single command to set up the full EtherCIS stack.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
After the startup procedure, you should see a message from the EtherCIS server to say it is 'listening' on some random URL like 'host:67e9af32b8a4 port:8080', which is an internal Docker reference. You should be able to access the server on `localhost:8080`.

You now have PytherCIS (the Python bindings for your CDR) and EtherCIS (the CDR) installed and ready to use.


## Getting Started: usage from the Python shell
As an example, I am describing usage in the interactive Python shell. Depending on your platform, there can be different ways to access the Python Shell. Consult the [Python docs](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for more help

```python
╰─$ python
Python 3.5.2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from pythercis import main
```

Instantiate an Ethercis object, passing it the **base URL of the Ethercis server**, and **valid login credentials**. A list of valid [Spaceballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs)-inspired passwords for a vanilla EtherCIS install are [here](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/examples/config/security/authenticate.ini). The following combination ('root'/'secret')should work on a vanilla install.

```python
>>> ehr = main.Pythercis(baseurl='http://localhost:8080', username='root', password='secret')
)
```
This creates the session and sets up your connection to the EtherCIS server in one command

You should get back a JSON response in the python shell, containing a `sessionId`, which tells you that you are authenticated to the server. This `sessionId` is needed for all your future interactions with the EtherCIS server.

PytherCIS will cache this sessionId for you and pass it into the HTTP headers of all future interactions automatically. You can also access it via the method `Pythercis.session_id`.

```python
>>> ehr.session_id
'sessionId:172.18.0.3-root-152222748992-563552143-2'
```

## Setting up openEHR Templates
openEHR CDRs don't come with any templates out of the box, so in order to do anything useful with the CDR, you'll need to upload a template or set of temlpates. This step is akin to running a schema against a conventional database, or running a migration in a web framework's ORM. Templates are uploaded via the REST API.

There are some example openEHR templates in the `operational_templates/` subdirectory of this repository, which you can use for testing. Operational Templates can also be created by exporting them from the [openEHR Template Designer](https://www.openehr.org/downloads/modellingtools) UI.

The `.opt` 'technical' template artefact that is uploaded to the openEHR CDR is different to the `.oet` format in which templates are designed and serialised normally. Operational Template wrap up all the archetype dependencies (eg openEHR archetypes) into one file.

List available templates on the EtherCIS server
```python
>>> ehr.list_templates()
{
"meta": {
"href": "rest/v1/template"
},
"templates": []
}
```

We were, of course, _expecting_ that there wouldn't be any templates there initially - this step serves as a nice way to check everything is working fine and we'll repeat it again after we've uploaded our template, and we should see the newly-uploaded template listed.

Upload an openEHR template to the EtherCIS CDR with the relative path
```python
>>> ehr.upload_template('/path/to/operational/template.opt')
{
"meta": {
"href": "rest/v1/template"
},
"action": "CREATE",
"templateId": "HDAY - Epidural Report.v0"
}
```

List available templates on the EtherCIS server again
```python
>>> ehr.list_templates()
{
"meta" : {
"href" : "rest/v1/template"
},
"templates" : [ {
"path" : "/etc/opt/ecis/knowledge/operational_templates/HDAY - Epidural Report.v0.opt",
"lastAccessTime" : "2018-02-28T12:18:29.911170Z[Etc/UTC]",
"lastModifiedTime" : "2018-02-28T12:18:29.911170Z[Etc/UTC]",
"templateId" : "HDAY - Epidural Report.v0",
"createdOn" : "2018-02-28T12:18:29.911170Z[Etc/UTC]"
} ]
}
```


## Developing PytherCIS
Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:Epidurio/pythercis.git
```


### Running the tests
Each action in Pythercis should have tests which cover standard and 'edge-case' usage

To run the test suite:
```bash
$ python -m unittest test.pythercis-test
```
or
```bash
$ python test/pythercis-test.py
```
